# Redirect Cloud Function for Amazon Ratings

This repository contains a Firebase Cloud Function designed to perform geographical redirection based on the user's IP address. It's particularly useful for redirecting users to domain-specific pages or services, ensuring that they reach the most relevant content based on their location.

You can deploy this function and once a user, who bought a book on Amazon clicks on the link, they will be reidrected to the correct Amazon Store (US, DE, FR, ...) based on their IP address or langauge. Default always forwards to amazon.com

Tip: Use a QR code so the user can scan even easier.

## Functionality

The `geoRedirect` function:

- Checks if the domain making the request is allowed.
- Retrieves the user's IP address.
- Determines the user's geographical location using the `geoip-lite` library.
- Redirects the user to a specific URL based on their country, with a fallback to a default domain.
